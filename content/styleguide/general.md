# General recommendations

General recommendations to be satisfied before page deployment

## General documentation recommendations:

1) Follow styleguide, write similar parts of documentation using same techniques (example: https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/ )
2) Use page templates (example: https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/write-new-topic/ )
3) Tutorials should start with “Before you start” section contains pre-flight checks, and end with “What`s next?” section with post-action checks and links to next steps of tutorial
4) Specify content types and supply them with templates (Concept, Task, Tutorial, Reference)
5) Every page should have a concrete purpose (how this page may help user)
6) Write short and clean because:
- it`s easier to keep up to date
- and easier to concentrate on main idea
7) Each page should start with short structure plan (using templates if it`s possible)
8) Who is the target audience of the page?
9) What reader wants to achieve?
10) Use answers as section titles
11) Answer them short and clearly 
12) Use “tell in your own words” tip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6zeikbTgVc&ab_channel=LeadDev 5:43) (можно использовать расшифровки записи устной речи)

- STRUCTURE instead of text chunk
